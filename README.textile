h1. orochi

p. A ruby gem that helps ActiveRecord-ize directions and route data.

p. Note: this gem has only been tested in Rails 3

h2. setup

pre. sudo gem install orochi
rake orochi:awaken

h2. quick start

p. Orochi needs to know which models you intend to make routeable.  So any model that has a start and stop destination can be represented as:

pre. class YourModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_routeable
end

p. Orochi still isn't quite smart enough to make the association on its own, so for the time being you will have to generate a migration:

pre. rails generate migration add_router_id_to_your_model

p. add in the necessary columns:

pre. class AddRouterIdToYourModel < ActiveRecord::Migration
  self.up
    add_column :your_models, :router_id, :integer, :references => :routers
  end
  self.down
    remove_column :your_models, :router_id
  end
end

p. then run the migration:

pre. db:migrate

p. Now you're set up and ready to go!

h2. usage

pre. your_model_instance.set_endpoints!("start_address", "stop_address")
your_model_instance.route!

p. Now you can do some of the following:

pre. # Get the polyline of your route
your_model_instance.polyline
